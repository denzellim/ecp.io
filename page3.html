  <h1>Where to eat in East Coast Park</h2>
  <h2>1. East Coast Lagoon Food Village</h3>
  <img src="Eastlagoonvillage.jpg" width="1000" height="600">  
  <p>Seafood by the beach – what could be better? This is the place to hit up if you’re looking for a spot to have a meal with a large group of friends. <br>Plenty of stalls specialise in barbecued seafood, as well as satay and other local delights, so take your pick. Don’t forget to order a side of rojak <br>for some variety.

  <p>Thanks to PS.Cafe’s East Coast branch, we now can enjoy decadent brunch delights by the sea. Look forward to chorizo and calamari stew, <br>salmon benedict, crab tart and beer-battered fish and chips. Oh, don’t forget to put in an order for the eatery’s popular truffle fries.

  <h2>3. Jumbo Seafood</h2>
  <img src="jumboseafood.jpg" width="1000" height="600"> 
  <p style>Here’s a fun fact: this iconic seafood restaurant opened its first outlet at East Coast Park in 1987. Now, onto the food – though most of us need <br>no introduction. Go straight for the chilli crab and mop up the delish gravy with deep-fried golden buns. Other highlights include bamboo clam <br>steamed with minced garlic, cereal prawns and seafood fried rice. Bring the entire fam for communal-style dining!

  <h2>4. Macdonald's @ Marine Cove</h2>
  <img src="mcd-marine-cove-4.jpg" width="1000" height="600">
  <p>The old McDonald’s @ East Coast Park was one of the most popular fast food outlets in Singapore. When McDonald’s returned to the redeveloped <br>Marine Cove with a fresh concept store, the crowd returned as well. It is one of the reasons why many people gather in Marine Cove.
  <p>McDonald’s at Marine Cove is spacious with an air-conditioned dining area as well as a non-air conditioned space overlooking the children’s playground.
