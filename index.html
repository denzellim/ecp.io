  <p>East Coast Park is a beach and a park encompassing Marine Parade, Bedok and Tampines, along the southeastern coast of Singapore. 
  <p>The long stretch of park and beach along the East Coast is a long time favorite picnic spot for families. 
  <p>Paddle in the sea and build sandcastles or get active on bikes and blades. Perhaps, just grab a nice shady spot and relax with nature and enjoy a packed picnic <br>or bbq at one of the bbq pits provided. If you’re feeling adventurous, you could even make a weekend of it and pitch a tent to camp overnight.
